# .Class Docs

This repository contains the back-end for the .Class app, which is a work-in-progress yearbook app for a coding bootcamp our team all attended.

The MVP of this app was built in one week by our team: [@madisonlowe](https://github.com/madisonlowe), [@Udecunup5](https://github.com/Udecunup5), [@samsonhumber](https://github.com/samsonhumber) and [@Ismailali99](https://github.com/Ismailali99).

For the full documentation for this project, please see this matching [front-end repository](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w9_frontend-project-room-21-1).

Thank you for visiting!
