Back-end plan Tuesday

# Mock database in libs folder - an object containing all the categories we want right now

 - Id, Name, Region, Job Title, Pronouns, Image Link, Contact Info, Links

# Do our database intiation SQL things like create and populate, using the data from our libs to test

# Import the environment variables into db/index.js and link up with our data?

# Route functions - start with get all for now, and only after, migrate this to the models section

# Look into encryption and information safety to incorporate

# Finally get a mock client in our app.js

# Make formal unit tests
